1. Developed a spam SMS detection model using a dataset of 5,574 messages labeled as "ham" (legitimate) or "spam."
2. Conducted data preprocessing, including cleaning and mapping labels to numerical values, and performed exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's distribution.
3. Transformed text messages into numerical data using CountVectorizer and trained a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on the processed data.
4. Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics, and visualized results through a confusion matrix.
5. Tested the model with new sample messages, demonstrating its ability to accurately classify unseen messages.
